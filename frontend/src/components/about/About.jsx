        I am a full stack software developer with an emphasis on modern React and Django Rest Framework. I love the challenges that come with taking on a large-scale project, from the technical functionality to the design and deployment. I am currently searching for a software team in need of a bright, fast-learning, and optimistic entry-level software engineer. I hope to find mentorship, feedback, and real connections in the professional world. I am very excited to be working with people as committed to their work and careers as I am. Enjoy the site!
